Feel the MERN (FTM) - A CLI for quickly launching a MERN project

Quickstart:
- FTM requires Python3, ttab, nodemon, and Mongodb to be installed
- clone the repo into your root folder (git@github.com:John-W-Stevens/feel-the-mern.git) (Read below if you want to put it somewhere else)
- Add all three zsh functions below to your ~/.zshrc file (assuming you are using zsh, otherwise add them to your bash profile)
- Create an empty project directory and navigate into it
- Run: feel-the-mern

What is it? FTM is bascially a collection of zsh commands wrapped in a single function
that, when invoked, walks the user through the intial setup of a MERN application. From the
command line a user can create an instance of Mongodb, and customize it by adding documents 
with full CRUD functionality. Users can create as many documents as they wish and customize them 
by adding attributes and validations. Currently, FTM only supports the use of built-in validations for 
the mongoose 'String' and 'Number' SchemaTypes.

After server-side configuration is completed the following file structure is the result:

project_directory:

    server
        config
            - mongoose.config.js
        controllers
            - doc_name.controller.js (for each doc specified)
        models
            - doc_name.model.js (for each doc specified)
        routes
            - doc_name.routes.js (for each doc specified)
    server.js

After configuring the server FTM moves on to the client.

An initial React app is created inside a folder called 'client' 
FTM pulls in axios, @reach/router, and bootstrap.css and then removes the following files
from client/src ( App.css, the logo, App.test.js,logo.svg ). It also adds two empty directories to src: /views and /components

At this point, FTM launches the server by running: { nodemon server.js } in a new terminal tab (using ttab) and the client by running: { npm run start }

Requirments for running this program:
- Python3: (all the underlying scripts are written in Python3 and FTM will call Python3 to run them)
- ttab: (necessary to launch server and client at the end, install with { npm install -g ttab } )
- zsh: I use macOS and, after switching to Catalina 10.15.4, have zsh as my default shell. I think all the commands can be run with bash as well
  so you should be able to added them to your bash profile. The following functions are saved in my ~/.zshrc file:

##### THE FUNCTIONS BELOW NEED TO BE ADDED TO ./zshrc

	setup-server(){
		git init
		npm init -y
		npm install mongoose express cors
		mkdir server
		mkdir server/config
		mkdir server/controllers
		mkdir server/models
		mkdir server/routes
		cp ~/feel-the-mern/config_controller.py ./
		cp ~/feel-the-mern/config_model.py ./
		cp ~/feel-the-mern/config_routes.py ./
		cp ~/feel-the-mern/config_server.py ./
		cp ~/feel-the-mern/helpers.py ./
		cp ~/feel-the-mern/master.py ./
		cp ~/feel-the-mern/mongoose_config.py ./
		python3 master.py
		rm -rf config_controller.py
		rm -rf config_model.py
		rm -rf config_routes.py
		rm -rf config_server.py
		rm -rf helpers.py
		rm -rf master.py
		rm -rf mongoose_config.py
	}
	
	setup-client(){
		npx create-react-app client
		npm --prefix ./client install axios @reach/router
		mkdir client/src/components
		mkdir client/src/views
		cp ~/feel-the-mern/bootstrap.css client/src
		rm client/src/App.css
		rm client/src/logo.svg
		rm client/src/App.test.js
		rm client/src/App.js
		cp ~/feel-the-mern/App.js client/src
		code .
	}

	feel-the-mern(){
		setup-server
		setup-client
		ttab nodemon server.js
		cd client
		npm run start
	}

After adding these functions, run: { source ~/.zshrc } (or the equivilent for bash)

As you can see from the zsh functions, FTM will look for scripts in ~/feel-the-mern
I put them there so I can use them every time I start a project. You can of course put these files wherever you want
provided you change the paths in the zsh functions. 

This is a work in progress!
